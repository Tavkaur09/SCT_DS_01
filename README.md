📊 Task 1: Visualizing Categorical and Continuous Variables Using Python

📝 Project Overview
This task involved creating visualizations to understand and communicate the distribution of both **categorical** and **continuous** variables using Python. It forms part of a broader journey in developing data analysis and visualization skills, especially in the context of economics and real-world datasets.

🎯 Objectives

Load and clean population data
Differentiate between categorical and continuous variables
Use appropriate charts (bar chart and histogram)
Simulate age data for visualization
Practice data storytelling using plots

📂 Dataset Used

Source: [World Bank Population Dataset (CSV)]  
Fields: Country Name, Country Code, yearly population figures

 📈 Visualizations Created

1. Histogram of world population (2022) — continuous variable
2. Bar chart of the Top 10 most populous countries — Categorical variable
3. Simulated age data using NumPy
   Histogram of age distribution
   Bar graph of age grouped in 10-year bins

 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn

📊 Sample Plots

You can find the sample outputs in the plots/ folder (or insert them as inline images here if you're uploading):

🔍 Key Learnings

Proper chart selection improves clarity and insight
Data cleaning is essential before visualization
Seaborn and Matplotlib offer powerful yet flexible plotting options
Simulated data can supplement real datasets for practice and proof-of-concept

🚀 What's Next?

This is Task 1 in an ongoing learning series. 
Stay tuned for Task 2!
